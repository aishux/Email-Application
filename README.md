Email Application :

Scenario: You are an IT Support Administrator Specialist and are charged with the task of creating email accounts for new hires.

Your application should do the following:
 Generate an email with the following syntax: firstname.lastname@department.company.com
 Determine the department (sales, development, accounting), if none leave blank
 Generate a random String for a password
 Have set methods to change the password, set the mailbox capacity, and define an alternate
email address
 Have get methods to display the name, email, and mailbox capacity

I have uploaded the zip file having the solution to the above problem statement.

The heirarchy is as follows :
Create a project -> Create a package "Email Admin App" - > Create class "Email.java" (having constructors and encapsulated methods)
                                                       - > Create class "App.java" (containing the "main" method ) in the same package
